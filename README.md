The Internet explorer can do this but you have to click on the picture and then save the picture to you hard disk and this take long time and Bowring.

This activex control can solve this problem just the only thing to do is drag drag drag and your picture is there to see it. For example every from us send a picture to demonstrate his program in the planet source just drag this link into this program and you will see the picture there. I hope you enjoy this simple and useful activex control.
